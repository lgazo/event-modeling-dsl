# Event Modeling DSL

Domain Specific Language (DSL) for writing [Event Modeling](https://eventmodeling.org/) models. The DSL in textual format can be translated to various outputs, mainly to a diagram.

The project uses [Langium](https://langium.org/), open-source tool to create DSL with Node.js and TypeScript.

Event Modeling model is defined in a text with prefered `.evml` file extension.

Requirements:

* `nodejs`
* `pnpm`

The root project purpose is to install local tooling required by Langium, mainly the Yeoman generator. Contrary to the `npm` mentioned and generated by Yeoman, the project uses `pnpm`.
