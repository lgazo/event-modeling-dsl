# Event Modeling DSL

Domain Specific Language (DSL) for writing [Event Modeling](https://eventmodeling.org/) models. The DSL in textual format can be translated to various outputs, mainly to a diagram.

[![Build project](https://github.com/lgazo/event-modeling-dsl/actions/workflows/event-modeling-ci.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/lgazo/event-modeling-dsl/actions/workflows/event-modeling-ci.yml)

## Install

There is VS Code compatible extension published.

For [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) use its [official Marketplace](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=LadislavGazo.event-modeling-dsl). Hit Ctrl+P and type:
```
ext install LadislavGazo.event-modeling-dsl
```

For [VS Codium](https://vscodium.com/) use [Open VSX Registry](https://open-vsx.org/extension/LadislavGazo/event-modeling-dsl).

## Usage

Event Modeling model file is defined in a text with prefered `.evml` file extension.

## CLI

The command line interface can generate SVG file out of `.evml` text definition.

Just call the CLI script like this:

```bash
./packages/cli/bin/cli.js svg ./packages/layout/test/multiple-source-frames.evml
```


## Technical details

The project uses [Langium](https://langium.org/), open-source tool to create DSL with Node.js and TypeScript.

Requirements:

* `nodejs`
* `pnpm`

The root project purpose is to install local tooling required by Langium, mainly the Yeoman generator. Contrary to the `npm` mentioned and generated by Yeoman, the project uses `pnpm`.

## Features

- [x] Domain Specific Language parser
- [x] Extract rendering to SVG ([available only in Mermaid fork](https://github.com/lgazo/mermaid/tree/feature/event-modeling-diagram))
