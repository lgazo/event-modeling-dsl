# Prompt

Implement a possibility to have live preview of Event Model files in VS Code extension `vscode-extension`. Add command "Event Model: Live preview" that renders `.evml` file in a parallel VS Code tab.
Whenever a source EVML file is changed, it should be applied to the live preview.
It uses `layout`, similar to `obsidian-plugin` package.
