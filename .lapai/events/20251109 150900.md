# Prompt

Implement a command "Event Model: Save as SVG" in the `vscode-extension` project. It should take the active Event Model file and export it as SVG. Use `layout` package for it. You can draw inspiration from `obsidian-plugin` where similar functionality exists. Don't use `layout-headless` as it requires Node native modules.
