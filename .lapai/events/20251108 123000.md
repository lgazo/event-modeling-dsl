# Prompt

Implement following improvement for `obsidian-plugin`. When right click on the generated EVML diagram, there is new context menu item "Explore event model". That opens separate view. It allows to zoom in, zoom out and pan in the generated SVG output. You can expand the view to full screen as well.

Constrain the generated output to the context of `obsidian-plugin`. Otherwise wait for human confirmation and further instructions.
