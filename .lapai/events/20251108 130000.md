# Prompt

Implement following improvement for obsidian-plugin. When right click on the generated EVML diagram, there is new context menu item "Save as Event Model". That saves the code block content into a file following pattern `event-model-<text content hash>.evml`.
Similarly, you implement another context menu item "Save as SVG". That saves the generated SVG from Event model done by the `this.renderer` in [main.ts](packages/obsidian-plugin/src/main.ts) function `renderDiagram`. The SVG file name follows the pattern `event-model-<text content hash>.svg`.
Text content hash is computed from the content of the code block.

Constrain the generated output to the context of obsidian-plugin. Otherwise wait for human confirmation and further instructions.
